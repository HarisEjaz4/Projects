Introduction

Introduction is like a summary. It shouldn't be too long as we don't want to read an essay on a project. We should describe in an interesting manner what's the project aim, and what problems does a given application solve. Two or three sentences are enough in case of a small project.

If it's a training project, mention your incentive. Why did you want to create it? To learn a particular technology? Was it a hackathon project? Was it for a non-profit organization? Is it an application created to memorize the material from workshops or and online course? It's worth mentioning here, without a doubt.

Technologies

Let's write down the languages we used, the libraries and its versions. 
For example:

    Bootstrap 3 or 4
    AngularJS 1.6 / Angular 2+/4/5/6
    PHP 5 or 7
    Python 2.7 or 3.6
    Rails 4 or 5


Why? Firstly, it will be helpful when launching the project in the future. The versions of libraries change, and an inconspicuous change might cause many problems later on. It's good to know the version that has been used when our code was working exactly the way we wanted. 

Another thing: recruitment. IT recruiters browse through their candidates' GitHub accounts. Even though they lack a technical knowledge to estimate the quality of solutions, they know the keywords related to their job offers. A description of used technologies might make you stand out among other candidates. 

Let's assume there's a multitude of candidates for an internship, and a recruitment time is limited. CVs have been selected, there are two similar candidates, and a last available date in a calendar. The candidates' GitHub accounts include the same number of projects. One of them mentions the technologies in every project. A second candidate doesn't add README files or his/her projects are described poorly. What do you think, which candidate will be invited for an interview?

Launch

How to run a project? Does a project has minimum hardware requirements?

We mentioned the libraries and their versions earlier. If necessary, technologies, launch, and hardware requirements can be merged together. But if we split it into two subsections, it's worth to focus here specifically on launching a project. When we have a website or application, it can concerned setting up a local environment, a link to GitHub pages or deployed application on Heroku. Do we need input data? If so, in what format?
